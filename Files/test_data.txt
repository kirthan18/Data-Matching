In the present global atmosphere, practices that for three centuries have been considered uncivilized, such as capturing civilians or even entire communities for ransom, have begun to reappear. <BR> Pursuing bold and provocative paths of inquiry, van Creveld posits the inadequacies of our most basic ideas as to who fights wars and why and broaches the inevitability of mans need to play at war.

The author provides essential theoretical background at each step, along with carefully designed laboratory and homework exercises. This structured approach ensures a good grasp of basic electronics as well as an excellent foundation in wireless communications systems. The author begins with a thorough description of basic electronic components and simple circuits. He then describes the key elements of radio electronics, including filters, amplifiers, oscillators, mixers, and antennas. In the laboratory exercises, he leads the reader through the design, construction, and testing of a popular radio transceiver (the NorCal 40A), thereby illustrating and reinforcing the theoretical material. A diskette containing the widely known circuit simulation software, Puff, is included in the book. This book, the first to deal with elementary electronics in the context of radio, can be used as a textbook for introductory analog electronics courses, or for more advanced undergraduate classes on radio-frequency electronics.

But somehow the oft-repeated tale of Christs passion can become too familiar, too formalized, for us to experience its incredible immediacy. The meditations in Reliving the Passion, which received a Gold Medallion Award in 1993, follow the story as given in the gospel of Mark---from the moment when the chief priests plot to kill Jesus to the Resurrection. But these readings are more than a recounting of events; they are an imaginary reenactment, leading the reader to re-experience the Passion or perhaps see it fully for the very first time. As only a great storyteller can, Walter Wangerin enables the reader to see the story from the inside, to discover the strangeness and wonder of the events as they unfold. Its like being there. In vivid images and richly personal detail, Wangerin helps us recognize our own faces on the streets of Jerusalem; breathe the dark and heavy air of Golgotha; and experience, as Mary and Peter did, the bewilderment, the challenge, and the ultimate revelation of knowing the man called Jesus. The story gets personal for every reader, writes Wangerin, for this is indeed our story, the story whereby we personally have been saved from such a death as Jesus died. No, there is not another tale in the world more meaningful than this---here is where we all take our stands against sin and death and Satan, upon this historical, historic event.
